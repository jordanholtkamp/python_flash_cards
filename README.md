# Flash Cards
This is the first project that I ever completed when I first started to learn to code. I did it in Ruby, and now that I am finished with my formal education, I am trying to expand my knowledge as much as possible. So, I decided to rebuild this project in Python. I remember how stressed out was when I built this in Ruby the first time. It took the better part of a week with a couple all nighters. I think building it in Python took about four hours tops, and was a whole lot of fun!
